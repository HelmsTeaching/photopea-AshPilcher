Image of typical "business men" sitting and standing around a computer at a table in a conference room overlaid with a slightly transparent image of a man in a wheel chair reading on a tablet using a mouth stick.

Discussion
With this image, I was trying to connect the two "Accessibility should lead us to think not just about opening doors, but also ensuring that these enterances and pathways are designed from the beginning so that no one needs to come in through the back enterance" (Eyman, et. al.) and "Professional design jobs in nearly all fields are disproportionately allocated to people who occupy highly privlieged locations within the matrix of domnation" (Costanza-Chock).
